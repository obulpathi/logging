Pig produces a warning for the invalid field (not shown here) but does not halt its
processing. For large datasets, it is very common to have corrupt, invalid, or merely
unexpected data, and it is generally infeasible to incrementally fix every unparsable
record. Instead, we can pull out all of the invalid records in one go, so we can take
action on them, perhaps by fixing our program (because they indicate that we have
made a mistake) or by filtering them out (because the data is genuinely unusable)
